    *   **Environment and Dependencies Management:** While an environment was set up, errors occurred due to an incompatible version of scikit-learn. Ensuring that the correct version of scikit-learn (`1.5.1`) is installed is vital. Additionally, a deeper understanding of environment and dependency management is crucial for avoiding compatibility issues.

*   **Lessons Learned:** 
    *   Traditional methods for diagnosing cirrhosis, like biopsies and imaging, can potentially be complemented or replaced by machine learning models using features like Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Bilirubin, and SGOT.
