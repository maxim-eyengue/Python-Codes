## Project Description
This project focuses on building and comparing machine learning models to predict diabetes based on diagnostic features. The workflow includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison of different classifiers
- Feature importance analysis
